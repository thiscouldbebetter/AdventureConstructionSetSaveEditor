Installing and Running
_Adventure Construction Set_
============================

Follow the instructions below to download and install
the classic DOS game _Adventure Construction Set_
and run its demonstration adventure, "Rivers of Light",
using the DOSBox emulator running on a computer running
the Windows 10 operating system.

1. Download _Adventure Construction Set_ as a .zip file,
perhaps from the URL

	https://www.myabandonware.com/game/stuart-smith-s-adventure-construction-set-1qr#download.

(Note that the author of these instructions does not control
the myabandonware.com website.  At the time of this writing,
it does not seem to be distributing malware, or at least not
obvious malware.  And that may change in the future, of course.)

2. Extract the contents of the downloaded .zip file
into any convenient directory.  For these instructions,
it will be assumed that it is extracted to C:\Temp\ACS.

3. Download the DOSBox installer from the URL

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/latest/download

to any convenient location, such as the desktop
or to the C:\Temp directory.

4. Double-click the downloaded .exe file for the DOSBox installer
to install DOSBox.

5. Start DOSBox, perhaps by double-clicking the icon it
installed on the desktop by default.

6. In the DOSBox console, enter the command

	mount C C:\Temp\ACS

This will "map" the DOSBox virtual machine's C: drive
to the directory on the Window host machine to which ACS was extracted.

7. Still in DOSBox, enter the command

	C:

to switch to the DOSBox virtual machine's newly mapped C: drive. 

8. Still in DOSBox, on the C: drive, enter the command

	ACS

and verify that the game starts, and that it begins to cycle
between the title screen, some screens describing the features
of the game, and a short demonstration of gameplay.

9.  Press Ctrl-F11 and Ctrl-F12 to adjust the speed of the
DOSBox virtual machine so that each screen is shown
for a reasonable amount of time.  On most modern host systems,
likely this will mean slowing it down significantly
by pressing Ctrl-F11 repeatedly.  Make a note of the correct speed,
given in the title bar of the DOSBox window.

10.  Press the spacebar to go to the main menu screen,
then press F1 to "make an adventure disk".

11. On the "Create an Adventure Disk" screen, use the arrow keys
to move the cursor to "Rivers of Light",
then press the Insert key to confirm the selection
and proceed to the next screen.

12. On the "Adventure Creation Procedure" screen,
press the Insert key again to attempt to start
creating the adventure.  However, this will fail,
because there is no way to change the disk
to which the adventure is being written.

13. Close the DOSBox Window, perhaps by clicking the X button
in the upper-right corner.

14. Back on the Windows host machine, start Windows File Explorer
and open the extracted ACS directory within it,
then right-click on a blank area in the main pane,
select the item "New > Text File" from the context menu that appears,
and rename the new file created to "ADVEN.HRD".

15. Repeat steps 5-8 to restart DOSBox, map the guest drive
to the host drive, and run ACS.  However, this time the ACS
title screen will with a significantly less attractive title screen,
and none of the features and demo screens.  This seems to indicate
that the program is in "create adventure" mode.

16. Press F1 to "make an adventure disk".

17. Once again on the "Create an Adventure Disk" screen,
use the arrow keys to move the cursor to "Rivers of Light",
then press the Insert key twice to confirm.

18. This time, a message reading "The adventure disk is ready!"
will appear.  Press the Insert key to return to the
"Create an adventure disk" screen, then use the arrow keys
to navigate to the "Exit" item and return to the main menu screen.

19. Back on the main menu screen, press the F7 key to play
the newly created adventure.
