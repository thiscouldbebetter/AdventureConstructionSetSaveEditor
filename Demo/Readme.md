Contained in this directory are "adventure files"
for _Adventure Construction Set_ (_ACS_).
In order for one of these adventures to be played,
it should be copied into the same directory as acs.com
and renamed to "adven.hrd" (though case doesn't matter),
before running acs.com.

The files "Rivers_of_Light.adven.hrd" and
"Land_of_Aventuria.adven.hrd" contained in this directory
are unmodified instances of full adventure scenarios
that came built into _Adventure Construction Set_.
The copyright for this content likely belongs to whomever
holds the copyright for _Adventure Construction Set_ itself.
It is used here on fair use grounds;
however, if the legitimate copyright holder objects,
it will likely be swiftly and cowardly removed.
